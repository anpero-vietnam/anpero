				<description><![CDATA[Both are gas-discharge lamps that use electricity emitted from cathodes to excite mercury vapor contained within the glass envelope, using a process known as inelastic scattering. Phosphors and a noble gas such as argon are also contained within the glass envelope.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The compact fluorescent light bulb or lamp is a type of fluorescent lamp generally designed as a replacement for incandescent or halogen lamps. There are two major types of compact fluorescent lamp, screw-in and plug-in. Screw in lamps are self-ballasted and can generally be placed in an existing screw socket without any additional equipment, plug-in bulbs require a ballast and a socket that corresponds to their specific base configuration. These are also sometimes referred to as integrated (screw base) and non-integrated (plug base).</p>
<p>Both come in a wide variety of wattages, sizes, color temperatures, and base types, and they are known primarily for their efficiency, long life, low cost, and ease of upgrading. Although compact fluorescent lamps are considered to be a fairly recent technology, this bulb type was actually over 100 years in the making. Circline and U-bent bulbs were both created to reduce the overall length of fluorescent bulbs and were precursors to the CFL as it is known today.</p>
<p>The modern CFL was invented by Edward Hammer, an engineer at General Electric, but was not produced at the time due to high production costs. In 1980, Philips became the first manufacturer to mass-produce a compact fluorescent bulb with a screw-in base. Over the last 30 years, the technology has continued to improve. Today’s CFL is smaller, produces more light per watt, warms up more quickly, has better light quality, and is much cheaper than those in years past.<br />
s are functionally identical to linear fluorescent bulbs.</p>
<p>Both are gas-discharge lamps that use electricity emitted from cathodes to excite mercury vapor contained within the glass envelope, using a process known as inelastic scattering. Phosphors and a noble gas such as argon are also contained within the glass envelope. The mercury atoms produce ultraviolet (UV) light, which in turn causes the phosphors in the lamp to fluoresce or glow, producing visible light.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Smartphone Anner Iphon 6s 32gb Gold externally indistinguishable from its predecessor, which was released a year before its release, however, inside it is a completely different device. The ergonomic case of the model is now made of an even stronger aluminum alloy of the 7000 series (previously alloy 6003 was used), the main scope of which is auto, aerospace and space transportation. The improved display, which recognizes the touch strength of 3D Touch technology, is covered with shockproof glass Ion-X.</p>
<p>Smartphone Apple Anner Iphon 6s 32gb Gold, traditionally, received a new third-generation A9 processor with a 64-bit architecture that works in tandem with the M9 coprocessor. The overall performance of the 6s has increased by 70%, and the graphics efficiency has increased by 90%. The fingerprint reader of the second generation Touch ID also became faster. He is able to recognize the imprint and unlock the device in just a moment. Significant changes also touched cameras: iSight with a matrix of 12 megapixels now can shoot video with a resolution of 4K standard and 30 frames per second, and FaceTime received a matrix with a resolution of 5 megapixels.</p>
